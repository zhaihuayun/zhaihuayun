  * @brief     The CMM module monitors abnormal clocks and inject error after loop times in circle.
  * @details   Use the reference clock (LOSC/HOSC/TCXO/HS_CLK) to check whether the target target \
  *            clock (LOSC/HOSC/TCXO/HS_CLK/LS_CLK) is invalid. If the (LOSC/HOSC/TCXO/HS_CLK/LS_CLK) is invalid, \
  *            the interrupt service function is triggered for processing. You can design security protection \
  *            measures for the interrupt service function. If the interrupt trigger mode is set to non-clock \
  *            failure mode, the user needs to determine whether the count value is within the threshold after \
  *            each interrupt is triggered. If the count value is not within the threshold, the clock is \
  *            considered abnormal.
  *            The threshold includes the upper and lower thresholds. The upper and lower thresholds reflect \
  *            the redundancy of the system for the target clock offset. You can design the thresholds by yourself. \
  *            For details about how to calculate the thresholds, see the chip technical guide.
