  * @brief     The CFD module monitors abnormal clocks, inject clock error after loop times in cycles.
  * @details   Check whether the PLL reference clock (TCXO or HOSC) fails by using \
  *            the LOSC = 32Khz clock. If the clock fails, the interrupt service function \
  *            is triggered for processing, and the hardware system event 2 is triggered to \
  *            disable the APT and switch the master clock to the LOSC for protection. \
  *            Users can perform secure operations such as clock recovery or reset in the \
  *            interrupt service function. If the interrupt trigger mode is set to non-clock failure mode, \
  *            the user needs to determine whether the count value is within the threshold after each interrupt \
  *            is triggered. If the count value is not within the threshold, the clock is considered abnormal.
  *            For details about the PLL reference clock recovery mechanism, see the chip technical guide. \
  *            The interrupt type can be configured by users. Only the upper threshold is available. \
  *            For details about the calculation method, see the chip technical guide.
