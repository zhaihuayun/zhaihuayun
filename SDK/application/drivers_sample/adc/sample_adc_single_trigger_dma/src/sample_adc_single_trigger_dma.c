  * @brief   adc sample module.
  * @details In single sampling mode, the ADC sampling is triggered by software. After the sampling is complete,
  *          the DMA is triggered to transfer the result.
  *          (1) ADC strigger source is software. Use HAL_ADC_SoftTrigSample() to configure software tirgger SOC1.
  *          (2) ADC sample source is ADC1_SOC1. Select sample source in "g_adc.baseAddress" of SystemInit(),
  *           "ADC_SOC_NUM3" can be Modified. External input source: GPIO2_2/GPIO2_3
  *          (3) The ADC conversion result is read from DMA interrupt callback function ADC1DMACallback().
