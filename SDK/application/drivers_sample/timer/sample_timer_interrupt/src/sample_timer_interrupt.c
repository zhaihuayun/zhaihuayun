  * @brief   timer sample module.
  * @details This file provides users with sample code to help use TIMER function:
  *          1) TIMER runs period and triggers an interrupt every second.
  *          2) Change the period during TIMER running
  *          Phenomenon:
  *          The interrupt handler is executed every 1 second, after 10 second, the interrupt handler execute
  *          every 0.5 second and print "In interrupt" on the serial port.
