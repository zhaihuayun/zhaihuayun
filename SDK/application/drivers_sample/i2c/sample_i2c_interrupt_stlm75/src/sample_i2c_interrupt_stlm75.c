  * @brief   Sample for I2C Module Interrupt.
  * @details This sample is connected to the temperature sensor stlm75 to demonstrate how to use the HAL interface that
  *          operates in interrupt mode in the I2C driver.
  *          This sample must be connected to the stlm75 temperature sensor.
  *          Run the sample and print the temperature value through the serial port.
