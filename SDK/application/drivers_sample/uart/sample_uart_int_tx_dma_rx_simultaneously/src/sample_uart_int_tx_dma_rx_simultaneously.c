  * @brief   uart sample module.
  * @details Transmits and receive data simultaneously by interrupt tx and dma rx. During interrupt writing,
  *          UART_DMA can be read.
  *          (1) Interrupt sending data: The start address and character length to be sent are used as input parameters
  *          and transferred to HAL_UART_WriteIT().
  *          (2) UART_DMA receive data: The start address and receive length are used as input parameters to
  *          HAL_UART_ReadDMA().
  *          (3) The sample program continuously transmits interrupts and receives UART_DMA. During interrupt writing,
  *          UART_DMA can be read.
