  * @brief   uart sample module.
  * @details In interrupt mode, when the UART completes receiving data, it indicates that the data
  *          has been transferred to the preset memory. In this case, an interrupt is triggered.
  *          (1) Preset buffer: The user needs to create the memory space. Use the start address of the memory
  *          and the length of the character to be received as input parameters to HAL_UART_ReadIT().
  *          (2) Result reading: Read the result from the preset memory in the callback function of the UART.
