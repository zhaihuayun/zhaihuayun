  * @brief   uart sample module, DMA transfer direction: memory to peripheral.
  * @details In DMA mode, the DMA receives the transfer request from the UART and directly transfers the data
  *          to be transmitted from the memory to the UART for transmission.
  *          (1) Data to be sent: The start address and character length to be sent are used as input parameters
  *          and transferred to HAL_UART_WriteDMA().
  *          (2) Result determination: After the DMA transfer is complete, an interrupt is reported. You can add
  *          a flag to the DMA interrupt callback function to determine whether the transfer is complete.
