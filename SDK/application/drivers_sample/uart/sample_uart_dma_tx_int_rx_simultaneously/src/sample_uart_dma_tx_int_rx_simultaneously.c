  * @brief   uart sample module.
  * @details Implements the interrupt and UART_DAM transmit and receive data simultaneously.
  *          During UART_DMA write, the interrupt can be read.
  *          (1) UART_DMA transmit data: The to-be-sent start address and character length are used as input
  *          parameters and transferred to HAL_UART_WriteDMA().
  *          (2) Interrupt receive data: The start address and receive length are used as input parameters to
  *          HAL_UART_ReadIT().
  *          (3) The example program continuously transmits UART_DMA and interrupts data reception.
  *          During the UART_DMA transmission process, interrupts can be received data.
