  * @brief   uart sample module.
  * @details In interrupt mode, when the UART receives data from the peer end, the UART sends the received data to the
  *          peer end. The UART interrupt is triggered during the entire process of receiving and transmitting data.
  *          (1) Receive: The user needs to open the memory space. The start address of the memory and the length of
  *          character to be received are used as input parameters and transferred to HAL_UART_ReadIT(). The received
  *          data is stored in the cache.
  *          (2) Transmit: After receiving an interrupt, the data in the buffer is used as the data to be transmitted
  *          and is filled in HAL_UART_WriteIT().
