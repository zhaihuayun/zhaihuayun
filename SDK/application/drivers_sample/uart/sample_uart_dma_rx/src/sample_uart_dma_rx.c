  * @brief   uart sample module, DMA transfer direction: peripheral to memory.
  * @details In DMA mode, after receiving data from the UART, the DMA receives the transfer
  *          request from the UART and transfers the data to the preset memory.
  *          (1)Preset buffer: The user needs to create the memory space. Use the start address of the memory
  *          and the length of the character to be received as input parameters to HAL_UART_ReadDMA().
  *          (2) Result reading: Read the result from the preset memory in the callback function of the DMA.
