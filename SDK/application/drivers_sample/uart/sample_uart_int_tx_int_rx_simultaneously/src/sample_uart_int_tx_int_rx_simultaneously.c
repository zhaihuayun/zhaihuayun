  * @brief   uart sample module.
  * @details Transmits and receives data simultaneously by interrupt tx and rx. During interrupt writing, interrupts
  *          can be read.
  *          (1) Interrupt sending data: The start address and character length to be sent are used as input
  *          parameters and transferred to HAL_UART_WriteIT().
  *          (2) Interrupt receive data: The start address and receive length are used as input parameters to
  *          HAL_UART_ReadIT().
  *          (3) The example program continuously transmits and receives interrupts. During interrupt writing,
  *          interrupt reading can be performed.
