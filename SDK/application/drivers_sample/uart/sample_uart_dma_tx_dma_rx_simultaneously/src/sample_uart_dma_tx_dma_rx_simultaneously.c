  * @brief   uart sample module, DMA transfer simultaneously.
  * @details Transmits and receives UART_DMA data simultaneously. During UART_DMA write, UART_DMA can be read.
  *          (1) UART_DMA transmit data: The to-be-sent start address and character length are used as input
  *          parameters and transferred to HAL_UART_WriteDMA().
  *          (2) UART_DMA receive data: The start address and receive length are used as input parameters to
  *          HAL_UART_ReadDMA().
  *          (3) The sample program continuously transmits and receives UART_DMA. During UART_DMA write,
  *          UART_DMA can be read.
