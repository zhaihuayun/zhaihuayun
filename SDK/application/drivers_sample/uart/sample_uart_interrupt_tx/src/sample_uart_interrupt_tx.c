  * @brief   uart sample module.
  * @details In interrupt mode, an interrupt is triggered when the UART has finished transmitting data.
  *          (1) Data to be sent: The start address and character length to be sent are used as input parameters
  *          and transferred to HAL_UART_WriteIT().
  *          (2) Result determination: After the transfer is complete, an UART interrupt is reported. You can add
  *          a flag to the DMA interrupt callback function to determine whether the transfer is complete.
